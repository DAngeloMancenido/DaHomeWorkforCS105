# how to tie your shoe
# 1. Place the shoes on a flat surface. Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe
# 2. Tie a basic knot. Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe.
# 3. Make a loop with one of the laces. You should be holding the lace between your thumb and your first two fingers
# 4. Use your other hand to wrap the other lace around the loop. You should be holding it over your fingers and around the loop.
